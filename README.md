WebCV Content Management System
=======

WebCV CMS manages the backend JSON data for the WebCV App and gives the ability to add/edit/remove data to/from the JSON data file. Currently its a very basic form of CMS with ability to change the basic data, but its envisaged to control the whole backend operations of the WebCV App and function as an independent "Settings" App in near future.

Currently its missing the Login authentication, thats why the created file has to be manually put in place for the WebCV, but that is a top priority task besides API integration with the WebCV App itself
